                Musk is a native of South Africa, born in 1971 to parents who later divorced.
                His father was an engineer and his mother—originally from Canada—was a nutritionist.
                Musk was fascinated by science fiction and computers in his adolescent years.
                When he was twelve, he wrote the code for his own video game and actually sold it to a company.
                In his late teens, he immigrated to Canada in order to avoid the required military service for white
                males in South Africa.
                It was still the era of apartheid, the South African legal system that denied political and economic
                rights to the country's
                majority-black native population. Musk was uninterested in serving in the army, which was engaged at the
                time in a battle to
                stamp out a black nationalist movement. Thanks to his mother's Canadian ties, he was able to enroll at
                Queen's University in
                Kingston, one of Ontario's top schools.
                Musk had planned on a career in business, and he worked at a Canadian bank one
                summer as a college intern. This was his only real job before he became an Internet
                entrepreneur. Midway through his undergraduate education, he transferred to the University of
                Pennsylvania,
                where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics and a second bachelor's in physics a year later. From
                there, he won admission
                to the prestigious doctoral program at Stanford University in California, where he planned to
                concentrate on a Ph.D. in energy
                physics. He moved to California just as the Internet boom was starting in 1995, and he decided he wanted
                to be in on it, too.
                He dropped out of Stanford after just two days in order to start his first company, Zip2 Corporation.
                This was an online city
                guide aimed at the newspaper publishing business, and Musk was able to land contracts with both the New
                York Times and the
                Chicago Tribune to provide content for their new online sites.
                Musk was just twenty-four when he started the company, and he devoted all of
                his energies to see it succeed. At one point,
                "Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough."
                he lived in the same rented office that served as his company's headquarters, sleeping on a futon couch
                and showering at the
                local YMCA, which "was cheaper than renting an apartment," he explained in an interview with Roger Eglin
                of the Sunday Times of
                London. Still, the company struggled to fulfill its contracts and meet the payroll and other costs, and
                he looked for outside
                financing. Eventually a group of venture capitalists, investors who provide start-up money to new
                businesses, financed Zip2
                with $3.6 million, but he gave up majority control of the company in exchange.

                <h5 id="fourth-div-text">
                    Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (doing business as SpaceX) is an American aerospace
                    manufacturer,
                    a provider of space transportation services, and a communications corporation headquartered in
                    Hawthorne,
                    California. SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation
                    costs to
                    enable the colonization of Mars. SpaceX manufactures the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles,
                    several
                    rocket engines, Cargo Dragon, crew spacecraft, and Starlink communications satellites.
                    SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit
                    around Earth,
                    the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft, the first private
                    company to
                    send a spacecraft to the International Space Station, the first vertical take-off and vertical
                    propulsive landing
                    for an orbital rocket, the first reuse of an orbital rocket, and the first private company to send
                    astronauts to
                    orbit and to the International Space Station. SpaceX has flown the Falcon 9 series of rockets over
                    one hundred times.

                    SpaceX is developing a satellite internet constellation named Starlink to provide commercial
                    internet service. In January
                    2020, the Starlink constellation became the largest satellite constellation ever launched. The
                    company is also developing
                    Starship, a privately funded, fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary
                    spaceflight. Starship is
                    intended to become SpaceX's primary orbital vehicle once operational, supplanting the existing
                    Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and
                    Dragon fleet. Starship will have the highest payload capacity of any orbital rocket ever built on
                    its debut, scheduled for 2022.
